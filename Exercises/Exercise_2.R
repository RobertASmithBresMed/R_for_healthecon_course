# 1. check your enviroment
ls()

# 2. clear old df 
rm(list = ls())

# 3. read in the data from a website 
# dat <- read.csv("URL")
dat <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScHARR-PHEDS/R4ScHARR/master/data/df_framingham.csv")

# 4. get an overview of the dataframe using the str functiom

# 5. look at the first few rows using the head function

# 6. how many NAs are there in sysBP?

# 7. remove all NAs and overwrite dat

# 8. subset dat by sex - either select males or females

# 9. what is the median sys bp in the subsetted dataframe?

# 8. what is the maximum BP?

# 10. what is the total range of BP values, i.e. the difference between the highest and the lowest?

# 11. plot a histogram of BP in males/females

# 12. plot the relationship between age and BP

# 13. fit a linear regression model and assign it to an object called fit_m,
# and use summary(model) to show results

# 14. add regression line to plot

# 15. what is the predicted BP in a 40 year old?
