```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Excercise

1. Change the format to html
2. Use subsetting to present the results from one country only
3. Include the table in the report. See if you can present the columns year, lifeExp, pop and gdpPercap only

# Dataframe

```{r, echo = F}

df_gapminder <- read.csv(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScHARR-PHEDS/R4ScHARR/master/data/df_gapminder.csv")


```


## Including Plots

4. Add a plot with population over time in that country
5. Change the code so that the code chunk can't be seen in the report

```{r, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}


# load ggplot from library if using
library(ggplot2)



```

##

6. Report the change in population between the year 1957 and 2007
