# EXERCISE 9
##  1. Create vectors for the costs and utility of each treatment group
#  (e.g. v_u_trt    <- c(u_H, u_Trt, u_S2, u_D)

v_u_trt <-
v_u_no_trt <-
v_c_trt <-
v_c_no_trt <-
  
#  2. Estimate mean costs and QALYs for each year (hint: need to use matrix 
#  multiplication, matrix trace %*% vector of costs and utilities)
  
#  3. If you didn't in the the previous step, apply discount weights (hint: need
#  to use transpose function t() and matrix multiplication, 
#  e.g. t(vector of costs) %*% discount rate 
  
#  4. Create results table by combining the 4 vectors
