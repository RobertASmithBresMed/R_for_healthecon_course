## Introduction

R Markdown documents can be used to write reports. In this example I am rendering this report to PDF, but it could be output in Word (word_document) or as an online document (html_document).

# Dataframe

```{r, echo = F}

height <- c(1.38,1.45,1.21,1.56) # combine is used to create the vector.
weight <- c(45,42,43,50)
first_name <- c("Alice","Bob","Harry","Jane")
sex <- factor(x = c("F","M","M","F"))
df <- data.frame(height,weight,first_name,sex)
df$bmi <- df$weight / df$height^2 

df
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots. Here is BMI change over time

```{r, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}


# Plot these on a line graph
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data=df, aes(x=weight, y=height)) +
    geom_point()


```

##

You can include a value in the text. For example, Alice is `r toString(df[1, "height"])`cm tall
